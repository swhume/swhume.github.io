# Using odmlib to Create ODM and Define-XML Tools in Python
Sam Hume, CDISC, State College, PA 

## ABSTRACT

This paper introduces the  odmlib  Python library for working with ODM and its extensions and spotlights
using odmlib to generate a Define-XML v2.1 document. The odmlib library provides an object-oriented 
interface that simplifies creating and processing ODM or Define-XML documents. It supports serializations
in XML and JSON and provides the means to easily create custom ODM or Define-XML extensions. Odmlib also 
supports conformance checks and schema validation to ensure quality and standards compliance. The
odmlib library is available on GitHub under the MIT license. ODM models have been created for ODMv 1.3.2, 
Define-XML v2.0 and v2.1, Dataset-XML v1.0,  CT-XML v1.1.1, and Library-XML v1.0. The odmlib project is 
open to collaborators interested in making contributions such as new features, example programs, additional 
models, tests, or documentation.

## INTRODUCTION

Creating and processing ODM and its extensions like Define-XML can be challenging  and repetitive.
The  odmlib  package  provides a re-usable Python library that simplifies both creating
and processing ODM files.  It provides  an object-oriented interface to work with ODM that
simplifies programming tasks and abstracts away most of the XML knowledge needed to work with ODM
documents.  It serializes ODM as XML or JSON and supports round-tripping or converting from one
format to the other.

Odmlib and the associated example programs can be accessed via public GitHub repositories[1, 2]
and all the code has been released as open-source  software  under the MIT license.
Odmlib  is also listed on the CDISC Open-Source Alliance (COSA) directory[3]. The odmlib
package remains under development but  has been  used for metadata processing , such as generating
a study Define-XML. The remaining development work mainly involves additional testing and
implementing any resulting fixes or refinements, as well as improving the documentation.

This paper will highlight the basic features of odmlib for creating or processing ODM and Define-XML
files by walking through the steps to create a simple Define-XML file. For those interested in other
odmlib use cases and features ,  visit  the  references  at the end of the article that  provide links
to documentation, blog posts, and example programs  that you might find useful.

## CREATING A SIMPLE DEFINE-XML

This section, and most of the paper, highlight the basic steps needed to  generate a simple Define-XML 
v2.1 file. This example provides a foundation from which additional use cases can be explored
by exposing readers to  the  odmlib  basics .  Once the basics are understood, those interested
in learning more can explore  some of the other examples and documentation available.

For those who prefer working with code, a Jupyter Notebook containing the code used in this 
paper  is available in the  examples  repository[ 6 ]. A non-notebook version of the code 
in this paper can be found in  my GitHub  gists[7]. The code included in this paper has been tested 
with Python 3.8 and 3.9. 

## INSTALL ODMLIB

Despite the fact that  odmlib  remains under development, you don’t need to install  it from  the source.
The easiest way to install and start using  odmlib is by  using pip:

```
pip install  odmlib 
```

If you have an interest in contributing to  odmlib, you may want to install from the source, which can
be accomplished by cloning the odmlib GitHub repository[1].  With  odmlib installed, the next step
is to begin writing the code to create a simple Define-XML v2.1 file.

## CREATE THE ODM OBJECT 

After installing odmlib, the next step is to import the Define-XML v2.1 model. Many CDISC-developed,
ODM models come with odmlib, and we’ll focus on the Define-XML v2.1 model in this example. The 
Define-XML v2.1 odmlib model represents the  standard as defined in the specification and makes
it possible to create Define-XML elements as objects. To import the Define-XML v2.1 model start
your code with the following line: 

```
import odmlib.define_2_1.model as DEFINE
```

This example will also use the Python datetime module to set the current datetime: 

```python
import datetime

current_datetime  =  datetime.datetime.utcnow().replace(tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc).isoformat() 
```

With the imports taken care of and the current datetime set, we now create the ODM object and assign
it to the odm variable. The ODM object from the Define-XML v2.1 model is instantiated by setting values
for the desired attributes which must include all those defined as required in the Define-XML v2.1
specification. Certain attributes have a set of permitted values, such as FileType and ODMVersion,
while others have specific data types, such as CreationDateTime. 

```python
odm  = DEFINE.ODM(FileOID="DEF.COSA.DEMO", 
              AsOfDateTime=current_datetime, 
              CreationDateTime=current_datetime, 
              ODMVersion="1.3.2", 
              FileType="Snapshot", 
              Originator="Sam Hume",
              SourceSystem="odmlib", 
              SourceSystemVersion="0.1.4", 
              Context="Other")
```

Now that we’ve created the ODM object, which serves as the root element for the Define-XML document, 
we will continue to create the remaining Define-XML content in the same manner by creating objects. 

## CREATE THE REMAINING DEFINE-XML OBJECTS

Next, we will create the Study object and add the global variables to Study. In the Define-XML specification,
GlobalVariables variables, like StudyName, have values in the body of the element. In odmlib, you assign
values to the body of the element using the _content attribute as shown in the example code below.

```python
study = DEFINE.Study(OID="ST.DEFINE.COSA.001") 
study.GlobalVariables.StudyName = DEFINE.StudyName(_content="TEST Define-XML ItemGroupDef") 
study.GlobalVariables.StudyDescription = DEFINE.StudyDescription(_content="ItemGroupDef 001") 
study.GlobalVariables.ProtocolName = DEFINE.ProtocolName(_content="Define-XML ItemGroupDef") 
odm.Study = study 
```

Assigning the value of the XML element to the _content attribute makes it possible to serialize the
Define-XML as JSON  since “_content” becomes the name in the name/value pair. 

Now we have created a Study object that includes the GlobalVariable objects. The study variable is then
assigned to the Study attribute of the ODM object created in the previous step. When an object like Study
is created, the attributes are typically set at instantiation. Other Study object attributes, such as those
that represent child elements in the Define-XML specification, may be instantiated independently and then
assigned to the parent element as shown in the example above. Since the Define-XML v2.1 model follows
the specification, we know that Study is a child element of ODM, or in  odmlib, Study is an attribute of the
ODM class. This can also be determined by examining the odmlib Define-XML v2.1 model as described later in
this paper. 

Working with odmlib continues in this manner by creating Define-XML objects based on the elements defined in
the specification and building the Define-XML hierarchy from them. Next, we create the MetaDataVersion object. 

```python
mdv = DEFINE.MetaDataVersion (OID="MDV.COSA.IGD.001", Name="ItemGroupDefDemo001",
                             Description="ItemGroupDef COSA Demo", DefineVersion ="2.1.0")
```

Next, we create the Standards object, new for Define-XML v2.1. In this case we instantiate the Standard
object and append it to the Standard list of objects. The Standard list is an attribute of Standards.  

```python
mdv.Standards.Standard.append(DEFINE.Standard(OID="STD.1", Name="SDTMIG", Type="IG",
                              Version="3.2", Status="Final")) 
mdv.Standards.Standard.append(DEFINE.Standard(OID="STD.2", Name="CDISC/NCI", Type="CT",
                              PublishingSet="SDTM", Version="2021-12-17", Status="Final"))
```

Next, we create an ItemGroupDef object and add the ItemRef child elements.

```python
igd = DEFINE.ItemGroupDef(OID="IG.VS", Name="VS",Repeating="Yes", Domain="VS",
                SASDatasetName="VS",  IsReferenceData="No",  Purpose="Tabulation", 
                ArchiveLocationID="LF.VS", Structure="One record per vital sign measurement per visit per subject",
                StandardOID="STD.1", IsNonStandard="Yes", HasNoData="Yes") 

igd.Description.TranslatedText.append(DEFINE.TranslatedText(_content="Vital Signs", lang="en")) 
igd.ItemRef.append(DEFINE.ItemRef(ItemOID="IT.STUDYID", Mandatory="Yes", OrderNumber=1, KeySequence=1)) 
igd.ItemRef.append(DEFINE.ItemRef(ItemOID="IT.VS.DOMIAN", Mandatory="Yes", OrderNumber=2)) 
igd.ItemRef.append(DEFINE.ItemRef(ItemOID="IT.USUBJID", Mandatory="Yes", OrderNumber=3, KeySequence=2)) 
igd.ItemRef.append(DEFINE.ItemRef(ItemOID="IT.VS.VSSEQ", Mandatory="Yes", OrderNumber=4)) 
igd.ItemRef.append(DEFINE.ItemRef(ItemOID="IT.VS.VSTESTCD", Mandatory="Yes", OrderNumber=5, KeySequence=3))
igd.ItemRef.append(DEFINE.ItemRef(ItemOID="IT.VS.VSTEST", Mandatory="Yes",  OrderNumber=6)) 
```

When creating odmlib objects, odmlib validates that the content is complete and valid based on the
Define-XML specification. Before we continue adding objects, we will demonstrate what happens when we
attempt to create an object using invalid input. The next block of code shows an attempt to create an
ItemRef without the required ItemOID attribute. In this case, odmlib throws a ValueError exception . 

```python
try:
    ir = DEFINE.ItemRef(Mandatory="Yes", OrderNumber=1) 
except ValueError as ve:
    print(f"Error creating ItemRef: {ve}") 
```

That’s enough ItemRefs for this simple example. Next,let’s create a Class object. Then we will add
MetaDataVersion and ItemGroupDef to the odmlib hierarchy. 

```python
igd.Class = DEFINE.Class(Name="FINDINGS") 
odm.Study.MetaDataVersion = mdv 
odm.Study.MetaDataVersion.ItemGroupDef.append(igd) 
```

## CREATING AND SAVING A DEFINE-XML XML FILE 

With the very simple snippet of a Define-XML file we have defined, we will now use odmlib to write the
objects out as a Define-XML XML file . 

```python
odm.write_xml(odm_file="./data/cosa_define_demo.xml") 
```

The namespace definitions needed for the XML serialization of Define-XML are defined in the model and
generated automatically. 

To view the XML file, open the file and print it to the screen. 

```python
with open("./data/cosa_define_demo.xml", 'r') as file:
    cosa_odm = file.read() 
print(cosa_odm) 
```

## VALIDATING THE DEFINE-XML FILE

Now that the Define-XML file has been created, it can be validated against the XML schema published with
the standard. The following code demonstrates how to validate the Define-XML file we just created. If
you have followed the example the Define-XML file will validate successfully. You will need to update the
code to reference the schema file on your system. 

```python
from odmlib import odm_parser as P 

schema_file = "./schema/cdisc-define-2.1/define2-1-0.xsd" 
validator = P.ODMSchemaValidator(schema_file) 
try:
    validator.validate_file("./data/cosa_define_demo.xml") 
    print("define-XML schema validation completed successfully...")
except  P.odmlib.SchemaValidationError as ve: 
    print( f"schema validation errors: {ve}") 
```

## LOADING THE DEFINE-XML FILE 

In addition to providing an object-oriented way to create Define-XML, odmlib can also be used to load and
process an existing Define-XML file. To do this we need to import the Define-XML loader and load the document. 

```python
from odmlib import define_loader as DL, loader as LD

define_uri = "http://www.cdisc.org/ns/def/v2.1" 
loader = LD.ODMLoader(DL.XMLDefineLoader(model_package="define_2_1", ns_uri=define_uri)) 
loader.open_odm_document("./data/cosa_define_demo.xml") 
```

## PROCESSING THE DEFINE-XML

Now that the Define-XML file has been loaded, using the same object-oriented style we used to create
the Define-XML we can access and process content. The following code prints out the Study GlobalVariables
created earlier in this example . 

```python
odm = loader.load_odm() 
print( f"Study OID is {odm.Study.OID}") 
print( f"Study Name is {odm.Study.GlobalVariables.StudyName}") 
print( f"Study Description is {odm.Study.GlobalVariables.StudyDescription}") 
print( f"Protocol Name is {odm.Study.GlobalVariables.ProtocolName}") 
```

## TRANSFORMING THE DEFINE-XML TO A DICTIONARY OR TO JSON

In addition to XML, odmlib supports serializations in JSON and as a Python dictionary.
The following code demonstrates serializing the previously created content as a Python 
dictionary and printing it to the screen. 

```python
cosa_dict = odm.to_dict() 
print(cosa_dict) 
```
Similarly, the Define-XML can be converted to JSON.

```python
cosa_json = odm.to_json() 
```

Odmlib can convert JSON to XML or XML to JSON, known as round-tripping, which enables developers to work
in JSON and convert it to XML should they prefer JSON . 

## UNDERSTANDING MODELS

Odmlib includes models for ODMv1.3.2 and several ODM extensions, such as Define-XML v2.1,
Dataset-XML v1.0.1, CT-XML v1.1.1, and others. Additionally, you can create your own models or
ODM extensions as demonstrated in the library_xml example that provides the model for working with
the CDISC Library ODM media type. The models follow the specifications, so in many cases referencing
the standard specification provides enough information to work with odmlib. Alternatively, you can
reference the odmlib model class definitions that specify the models. For example, the CommentDef
element is part of the Define-XML namespace and is defined in the model as: 

```python
class CommentDef(OE.ODMElement): 
    namespace = "def"
    OID = T.OID(required=True)
    Description = T.ODMObject(element_class=Description) 
    DocumentRef = T.ODMListObject(element_class=DocumentRef, namespace="def") 
```

Every element of the model inherits from the ODMElement class. This class allows programmers to define
models that generate and validate ODM and Define-XML documents without writing any code to support the logic.
Define-XML the model and ODMElement take care of transforming the content into an XML document or JSON file. 

The above example highlights some basic elements of an odmlib model. In cases where the default namespace is
used, no namespace needs to be defined. In this case, CommentDef is part of the Define-XML namespace as indicated
with the namespace = “def” line. Developers need not worry about namespaces when working with odmlib since when
the Define-XML file is generated, it will add the appropriate namespaces based on the model. Developers can
define their own namespaces to create their own extensions to ODM or Define-XML.  

After the namespace, the element attributes are defined. Odmlib supports a wide range of attribute types to match
the types represented in the ODM and Define-XML specifications. CommentDef has just one attribute, the OID.
In this case, it is defined as type OID and is a required attribute. If you attempt to instantiate a CommentDef
class without the OID specified, it will throw an exception. 

Next the child elements are defined as objects. These may be defined as a single object or a list of objects. 
The specification for each object is defined elsewhere in the model and is referenced by the element_class
attribute. If the child object belongs to a different namespace, that is indicated by the namespace attribute. 

The odmlib models define a class for each element in the standard specification. Developers instantiate these
classes to generate XML, JSON, or a Python dictionary. Developers typically build a hierarchy from  the
instantiated objects to generate a complete ODM or Define-XML document as is demonstrated in example programs
like xlsx2define 2-1. 

## RUNNING THE DEFINE-XML EXAMPLE PROGRAMS

As noted previously, the odmlib_examples repository[2] contains a number of useful example programs.
The two most relevant examples for this paper are xlsx2define2-1.py and define2-1-to-xlsx.py. These programs
generate a Define-XML from a metadata spreadsheet and generate a metadata spreadsheet from a Define-XML file,
respectively. They are example programs and not intended to be  production software, but they have been used 
to generate Define-XML files and are a useful way to learn more about odmlib. Once odmlib and any other modules
listed in the requirements.txt file are installed, these programs can be executed from the command-line.
The following shows an example command-line to run the xlsx2define2-1.py program: 

```
python xlsx2define2-1.py -e ./data/odmlib-define-metadata.xlsx -d ./data/odmlib-define.xml
```

We'll use the following options when running  the application: 

```
- \-e provides the name and location of the spreadsheet file to use as input.
- \-d provides the name and location of the Define-XML file to generate as output.
```

The xlsx2define2-1.py comes with an example metadata spreadsheet so that you can run the application. You
can also generate a metadata spreadsheet from an existing Define-XML file using the define2-1-to-xlsx
example, update the spreadsheet metadata to match your needs, and then generate the new Define-XML using
xlsx2define2-1. The define2-1-to-xlsx example now includes an option to generate a Define-XML v2.1 metadata
spreadsheet from a Define-XML v2.0 file making it simpler to upgrade from Define-XML v2.0 to v2.1.  

Please note that these examples are not intended to indicate that using a spreadsheet is the ideal long-term
solution. Using spreadsheets happens to be a common use case and one that makes for a useful, standalone example.
Odmlib works equally well for generating Define-XML files when retrieving metadata from a metadata repository
or other data store. 

## ADDITIONAL ODMLIB USE CASES

Creating a Define-XML is a use case of broad interest, but there are many other uses of ODM and ODM extensions
including:
- Generating ODM CRF definitions for study setup
- Exchanging data using ODM
- Processing CDISC Controlled Terminology
- Generating a Define-XML for use as a study specification
- Generating standards metadata from content retrieved from the CDISC Library using the ODM media type
- Representing datasets using Dataset-XML

ODM supports a broad range of use cases, and odmlib makes it easier to work with ODM for Python programmers.  

## ODMLIB NEXT STEPS

The odmlib module has been demonstrated to work by passing its unit tests, by developing several example
programs, and by using it in production applications. That said, odmlib will receive additional testing
and use prior to an official version 1.0 release. The documentation will also be expanded and improved.  

ODM v2.0 will be supported in a future release once it gets closer to being released as a final standard.  
An odmlib model and examples will be developed to help test the ODM v2.0 specification as well as to add
support for this new model to odmlib.

## CONCLUSION
Although its testing continues, odmlib has been used for generating and validating Define-XML documents
in several projects. Once testing and documentation have been completed, an initial production version 
will be released.
