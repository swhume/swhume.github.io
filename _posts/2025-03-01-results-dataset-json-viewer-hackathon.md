# Results from the COSA Dataset-JSON Viewer Hackathon

We just wrapped up our 3rd Dataset-JSON COSA Hackathon, and this one may have been the best so far.
All 3 Dataset-JSON hackathons have produced impactful outcomes, and all have filled a need within 
the Dataset-JSON community. Since we started the PHUSE-CDISC-FDA Dataset-JSON pilot, folks have been 
asking me about the availability of Dataset-JSON Viewers. I'm thankful that I now have a good answer to 
that question.

Each of the 3 Dataset-JSON hackathons was organized differently. The first hackathon teams worked on any 
Dataset-JSON tooling that interested them. We stated a priority need for conversion tools, but there 
were no restrictions on the type of Dataset-JSON tools developed. That hackathon 
produced something like 21 projects and several conversion tools. Those same conversion tools allowed us to 
quickly start and successfully complete the PHUSE-CDISC-FDA Dataset-JSON pilot project. The second hackathon 
was a collaborative effort to produce a draft Dataset-JSON REST API specification. That API specification is 
now being used as a draft standard, and we plan to publish the final version later this year. Our third and
most recent Dataset-JSON hackathon was our first competitive one. For this hackathon, teams were tasked with
developing a Dataset-JSON Viewer. Several participating developers confessed that the competition motivated
them to invest more time and effort into their projects, and the results were evident in the high quality of
the work produced.

The Viewers created during the hackathon immediately fill a need within the CDISC community. 
Some organizations are testing Dataset-JSON for future use or implementing support for it in their products 
and have requested Viewers to function as part of their tooling. CDISC 360i will use Dataset-JSON, and the 
Viewers will be part of the 360i open-source tool set. Students attending CDISC's new Dataset-JSON training
class will benefit from Viewers to explore Dataset-JSON datasets. Overall, requests for a Dataset-JSON Viewer 
have come from numerous sources, including sponsors, regulators, vendors, and CROs.

When the Dataset-JSON Viewer Hackathon judges got together to compare our individual scoring and select winners, something 
unexpected happened - all 7 judges had ranked the top few projects the same. That made things easy. As a judge 
myself, I can say that all 7 Viewer applications submitted were solid. They did the basics quite well and were 
surprisingly capable given the limited amount of time the developers had to work on them.

The winning Viewer by Dmitry Kolosov, called the VDE Dataset Viewer, does many things well. It's a Viewer 
that runs locally on your laptop. It is very easy to install, intuitive enough to start using without reading 
the documentation, has a polished interface, has some advanced filtering capabilities, and it handled our 
very large dataset test well. Remarkable for a product developed during a short hackathon.

I believe that multiple Viewers may become widely used. Each project did some things well, and each 
may satisfy different user needs. For example, the runner-up in the hackathon created a very nice 
web-based system that could be made available from a server. Another team built an R-Shiny application 
that may be popular in R shops. Others have a rich feature set that goes beyond simply Viewing datasets, 
such as the Smart Submission Dataset Viewer with its conformance checking capabilities.

If you're interested in seeing a demo of these Viewers, make sure to sign up for the next couple 
quarterly CDISC COSA Spotlight Webinars as the project teams will be demonstrating their Viewers. 
The Q1 COSA Spotlight on Tuesday, March 25th at 11 AM-12:30 PM ET will feature demonstrations from the hackathon 
winner and runner-up. I think you'll be impressed by what they were able to accomplish in a short period of time.

Although the Dataset-JSON Viewer Hackathon was competitive, one of the cool dynamics was the free exchange of ideas 
and information between the participants. There is no doubt that the open-source nature of these projects 
contributed to the exchange of ideas, and I hope this cooperative dynamic continues as the developers evolve 
their tools.

COSA hackathons promote the development and application of open-source tools that support the 
implementation of one or more CDISC standards. As the adoption of open-source continues to gain traction 
in our industry, hackathons have proven to be a great way to tap into that open-source energy and address 
gaps in our tool or feature set. As CDISC kicks off 360i, we anticipate hosting 360i hackathons to fill gaps 
in our automated end-to-end standards-driven research data pipeline.
